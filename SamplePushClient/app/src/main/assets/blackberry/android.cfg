        after going through the registration process here:
        https://www.blackberry.com/profile/?eventId=8121
        appid is the Application ID and ppgurl is the Push URL -->

        <!-- The token prefix is an optional parameter which is appended to the start of
        each BlackBerry device Registration ID after registering with the push service.
        This is helpful for differentiating between registered BlackBerry devices and
        non BlackBerry devices on the push server. On this app, every BlackBerry Registration ID
        will have the format "bb-testXXXXXXXX", where XXXXXXXX is the device PIN. Registration IDs
        from Google will be in the following format: "APA91bHun4MxP5egoKMwt2KZFBaFUH-1RYqx" -->
        <tokenprefix>bb-test</tokenprefix>
