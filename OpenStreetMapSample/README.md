# OpenStreetMapSample - BlackBerry Android Runtime Sample

This sample application is an example of how to integrate Maps into your BlackBerry Android Runtime Application.

The Android Runtime does not currently support the Google Maps V2 APIs, so an alternative solution is to use [OpenStreetMap](https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid).
